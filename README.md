### Redux Usage

Redux is integrated into this application for state management. The main concepts to understand are:

- **Store**: The store holds the global state of the application.
- **Reducers**: Reducers are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
- **Actions**: Actions are payloads of information that send data from the application to the store.
- **Dispatch**: Dispatch is a function used to send actions to the store.

### E-commerce Functionality

The application simulates an e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout.

### Location Fetching

The application also includes functionality to fetch locations. Users can search for places to visit based on their preferences.
